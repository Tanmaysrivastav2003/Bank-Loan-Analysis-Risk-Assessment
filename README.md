📊 Bank Loan Analysis & Risk Assessment

This project analyzes loan applicant and repayment data to help banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions, identify risky borrower segments, and reduce loan defaults.

Through a combination of SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau, the project delivers actionable insights via dashboards and reports for both loan officers and senior management.

🚀 Project Objectives

Identify key factors influencing loan approvals and defaults.

Build dashboards in Excel and Tableau for monitoring loan performance.

Support loan officers in assessing borrower profiles more accurately.

Enable management teams to optimize lending policies and reduce NPAs (Non-Performing Assets).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL

Visualization Tools: Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts), Tableau

Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook, MS SQL Server

📂 Project Workflow

Data Collection – Loan dataset containing applicant details, loan info, and repayment history.

Data Cleaning & Transformation – SQL queries + Python scripts to prepare structured data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Python visualization to uncover borrower trends and default patterns.

Excel Dashboards – Pivot tables and charts to track loan KPIs (approval ratio, repayment rates, borrower demographics).

Tableau Dashboards – Interactive visualization for loan approval trends, risk segmentation, and performance monitoring.

📈 Key Insights

Loan default probability is strongly influenced by income level, credit history, and loan amount.

Borrowers with weak credit history show a 40% higher risk of default.

Excel dashboards enable loan officers to quickly filter and analyze borrower segments.

Tableau dashboards empower management to track loan performance in real-time and adjust policies.
